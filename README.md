# python-crypto

This is a colleciton of Python scripts demonstrating cryptographic principles.

All of these are derived from the Udemy course "Master Modern Security and Cryptography by Coding in Python" 

https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-modern-security-and-cryptography-by-coding-in-python/learn/lecture/21402408#questions

This is the work of the course instructor and the code is derived from their examples in the course lectures. I am uploading storing a copy of the code in the repository for my own use as they do not have git repository of the course code that I know of.
